Welcome to my second report using the STATREP package for LaTeX
In this report we were given an assignment to find a regression equation for a set of data.
The assignment and appropiate graph can be found the pdf file.

If you need any help with this package please feel free to contact me via my website. I have had some issues using this package in the past, because I use the University edition of SAS. This edition requires a few tweaks of the tradtional ways to use the package.

Enjoy! :)
